# EXP 4 Scenario-Based Report Development Utilizing Diverse Prompting Techniques- Lab Scenario: Smart Health Assistant System

# Background:
You are part of a development team working on an AI-based Smart Health Assistant named "MediGuide" that assists elderly patients in managing chronic diseases like diabetes, hypertension, and arthritis. The assistant must provide tailored health advice, medication reminders, daily tips, and emotional support through natural language conversations.

# Objective:
Develop a scenario-based report that demonstrates how diverse prompting techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role-based, and multi-modal prompts) can be used to optimize MediGuide’s responses in different use cases.

# Algorithm:
### 1. Zero-Shot Prompting
#### Definition:
Zero-shot prompting involves providing a task to the AI without giving any examples. The model is expected to generate a response based on its pre-existing knowledge and understanding.

### Use Case:
Providing general health tips to diabetic patients.

### Prompt Example:
"Provide a health tip for an elderly diabetic patient."


### Expected Output:
"Ensure to monitor your blood sugar levels regularly, maintain a balanced diet, and stay physically active to manage diabetes effectively."

### Explanation:
Zero-shot prompting tests the AI's ability to generate relevant responses based solely on task phrasing, making it useful for generalized use cases.

# 2. Few-Shot Prompting
#### Definition:
Few-shot prompting involves providing the AI with a few examples to guide its response. This technique helps the model generalize from the examples to new, similar tasks.
Learn Prompting

### Use Case:
Answering symptom-related questions.

### Prompt Example:
"Here are examples of responses to common symptoms:
-'I have a headache.' → 'Ensure you're well-hydrated and rest in a quiet, dark room. If it persists, consult your doctor.'
-'My knee hurts.' → 'Apply a warm compress and avoid putting pressure on it. If the pain continues, seek medical advice.'
-Now respond to: 'I feel dizzy in the morning.'"

### Expected Output:
"Morning dizziness can be due to low blood pressure or dehydration. Try getting up slowly and drinking water. If it persists, consult your healthcare provider."

### Explanation:
Few-shot prompting provides the AI with a few examples to guide its response, helping it generalize from the examples to new, similar tasks.

# 3. Chain-of-Thought Prompting
#### Definition:
Chain-of-thought prompting encourages the AI to break down its reasoning into a series of intermediate steps, enhancing its ability to handle complex tasks.


### Use Case:
Handling complex situations like missed medications.

### Prompt Example:
"A patient forgot to take their blood pressure medication this morning. Think step-by-step to decide what advice to give."

### Expected Output:
"-Step 1: Determine how late the dose is.
-Step 2: If it's only a few hours, it may be safe to take it now.
-Step 3: If it's close to the next dose, it may be better to skip and resume the regular schedule.
-Step 4: Recommend contacting their healthcare provider for confirmation."

### Explanation:
Chain-of-thought prompting guides the AI through a step-by-step reasoning process, enabling it to handle complex tasks more effectively.

# 4. Role-Based Prompting
#### Definition:
Role-based prompting involves assigning a specific role or persona to the AI model, influencing its tone, style, and focus of responses.


### Use Case:
Providing emotional support.

### Prompt Example:
"You are a kind and empathetic health assistant for elderly users. Respond to this: 'I feel lonely and tired today.'"

### Expected Output:
"I'm really sorry you're feeling this way. You're not alone — I'm here to talk anytime. Maybe a short walk, some music, or calling a loved one could lift your mood a little. Would you like me to suggest a calming activity?"

### Explanation:
Role-based prompts create compassionate and human-like conversations, important for patient comfort and engagement.

# 5. Multi-Modal Prompting
#### Definition:
Multi-modal prompting combines different types of data inputs, such as text, images, audio, or video, to guide the AI's response.


### Use Case:
Analyzing medication schedules or diet plans.

### Prompt Example:
(Input: Image of a meal plate + Text: "Is this a good breakfast for a diabetic?")

### Expected Output:
"This meal looks high in carbohydrates due to the white bread and fruit juice. For a diabetic-friendly breakfast, consider whole grain toast, a boiled egg, and unsweetened tea."

### Explanation:
Multi-modal prompting enables the assistant to understand visual inputs alongside text, useful in health and nutrition contexts.

# Result
Using diverse prompting strategies significantly enhanced MediGuide's communication and decision-making quality. The combination of zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role-based, and multi-modal techniques ensures the assistant delivers comprehensive healthcare support across various real-world scenarios.
